What is NodeJS?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance network applications. Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for building real-time applications, web servers, APIs, and more.

What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database management system designed for storing and managing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It uses a flexible, schema-less document data model, which allows data to be stored in a format similar to JSON documents. MongoDB is often used for web and mobile applications, content management systems, and other data-intensive applications due to its scalability, speed, and ease of use.

What is CRUD??
CRUD is a simple way to understand how we work with information in computers and databases. Think of it like using paper and pencils. Creating is when we make something new, like writing a new story on a blank page. Reading is like looking at what's already written in a book; we're just checking it out. Updating is when we want to change something that's already there, like adding more colors to a drawing we made earlier. Deleting is like throwing away a piece of paper or deleting a photo on our phone when we don't want it anymore. CRUD helps us talk about these four basic actions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete, and it's how we manage data and information in the digital world.
